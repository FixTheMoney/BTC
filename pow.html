        <p>
            Proof of Work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm used by Bitcoin to secure the network and validate transactions. 
            In PoW, miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles. The first miner to solve the puzzle gets to add a new block to the blockchain and is rewarded with bitcoins.

        <p>
            The process requires significant computational power, making it costly and difficult to attack the network. This ensures that only valid transactions are recorded and prevents double-spending.
